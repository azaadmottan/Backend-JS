# Axios:

## Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. It works both in the browser and in Node.js environments. Axios is promise-based, allowing you to take advantage of JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities and work with responses more easily.

Axios supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and provides a convenient API for customizing requests, handling responses, and managing request and response interceptors.

# CORS:

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows for controlled and secure exchange of data between a web page and a different domain than the one that served the web page. Without CORS, web browsers, by default, restrict cross-origin requests to ensure the security of web applications.

While CORS is indeed a security feature, it is more accurate to say that it facilitates safe cross-origin data exchange rather than making it more efficient.
